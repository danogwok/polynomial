# polynomial
This project contains C++ polynomial classes and related algorithms.
The primary polynomial class is a dense polynomial array with all of your favorite
polynomial arithmetic operator overloads.
It is designed to work with C and fortran algorithms that have a size, pointer interface.

I am working on a sparse polynomial that is a set of (possibly multivariate) monomials.

This library has implementations of several root finders including Jenkins-Traub and Bairstow, and Laguerre and quadratic factorization steppers.
